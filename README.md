Interactive Front-end Development Milestone Project – **Memory Game**
=====================================================================

Color circle memory game it’s a game inspired by Simon, in this game the player has to follow the pattern of lights and sounds and repeat the same combination to move on to the next round. The sequence will start with one color, then it will increase as long as the player gave correct match.

Planning and resources:
--

I planned to get the rounded shape of the game with pure Css styling. No images have been used to create the shape.

The shape will be resembled by the physical game with some enhancement to give it better user experience as it’s an online game.
A set of tone for each button. This will have the effect of creating different tonalities and melodies.

Create a performance box that will show up every time the user got failure to show him how many rounds he succeeds and how much time it takes in each round and in total rounds.

The logic builds with Java Script and jQuery,
For the layout I used bootstrap, Comfortaa google font, font awesome for the icons and bootstrap tour for tutorial. 

Game Logic:
--
1.	Once the user starts the game a random array of sequence will start with one value.
2.	user replicates the sequence
3.	Every button the user clicked will be check and compared with the original pattern.
4.	if correct the pattern will increases by one.
5.	If wrong a failure sound will play and the game will stop
6.	A performance box will show will how many rounds has been succeeded with a duration time

Features:
--
Ability to change the background of the screen to be more convenience with the player needs.
A tutorial option for first time users.
ability of turn off the sound which make it a bit harder to remember 
The game has been made as a mobile app and can be downloaded for here:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.colorcircle.game
